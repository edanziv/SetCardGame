3. **Edit the configuration file** at `/src/main/resources/config.properties` as needed:
    - `HumanPlayers`: Number of human players.
    - `ComputerPlayers`: Number of computer players.
    - `Hints`: `True`/`False` â€” show legal sets currently visible on the table.
    - `PlayerNames`: Players' names, separated by `, ` (see example in file).
    - `TurnTimeoutSeconds`:
        - `> 0`: Regular countdown timer mode (default is 60 seconds).
        - `= 0`: "Free play" mode (no timer).
        - `< 0`: "Elapsed" mode (timer resets after a legal set is collected).
